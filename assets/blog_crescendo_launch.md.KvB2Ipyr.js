We stand at the forefront of innovation in customer service, aiming to radically transform how businesses interact with and serve their customers.</p><hr><p>We’ve all been lucky to work for many years in the pursuit of creating customer service excellence. Anand, Matt and Slava in customer experience technology, and Andy in contact centers.</p><p>Through our careers, we’ve felt incredibly close to a new chapter in customer service. And we’ve done pretty well. Our tech and our people have already served billions of customers. We pushed the boundaries of what industry models would allow. But ultimately, our innovations were held back by the same two issues that have persisted for decades.</p><p>The first issue is that we’d only been able to address a part of the customer service chain. We built tech products and contact centers that were designed to improve the end experience. A great idea. But to see real change in customer care, contact centers have to actually buy the product. Then they have to figure out how to implement it, train agents, connect it to their business — all without breaking already razor thin margins. No surprise that 80% of contact centers are still using tech developed over 20 years ago. Most innovations just aren’t given the chance to succeed in the field.</p><p>The second issue is that tech companies and contact centers aren’t incentivized to offer great customer service. Customers want their problems solved as quickly as possible. But the more people and the more time it takes to solve a customers’ problem, the more money customer service businesses make. Again, not the fault of these businesses - more a problem with the underlying industry model.</p><p>So what’s different now?</p><p>The obvious answer is AI. The entire industry recognizes that digital agents can do much of the legwork for human agents, freeing them to work on productive, fulfilling customer engagements.</p><p>Here’s how it changes those two stubborn issues:</p><p>First, harmonizing that an AI - human experience can only be achieved with deliberate orchestration. The separation between technology product and contact center just doesn’t make sense anymore.</p><p>Second, AI can now examine every customer interaction to determine how well the customer was served. We want to apply this technology to a new model, where the people who provide service only get paid when the service is good.</p><p>After years of seeing trends come and go, our team is confident that we’re at a moment unlike any other. AI is moving quickly. It’s time to finally usher in the industry change that we’ve been hoping for in customer experience.</p><p>We named our company for the moment in a piece of music when players combine, and hit an intensity. That’s what we’re aiming for. For us, it’s our time to drive CX innovation to a new peak — our crescendo.</p><p>Anand, Andy, Matt and Slava.</p>",14),s=[r];function i(c,h,d,u,l,m){return t(),n("div",null,s)}const v=e(a,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,v as default};
